This paper proposes the "Spatial Cell Theory", aiming to establish a new ontological foundation for physics based on discrete spacetime and to provide a unified and intuitive physical picture for the microscopic dynamics of quantum mechanics and gravity. The theory rests on two core postulates: spacetime is composed of discrete fundamental units called "spatial cells"; simultaneously, the functional duality of a cell—its "Open Dimensions" and "Closed Dimensions"—collectively determines the separation and coexistence of quantum phenomena and classical physics. We argue that a regular octahedron or its topologically equivalent spherical structure serves as the ideal geometric carrier for this cell. In this model, the three orthogonal axes (Open Dimensions) inside the cell constitute the framework for light-speed propagation and classical locality, while its twelve edges or arcs on the surface (Closed Dimensions) form an intrinsic network that maintains structural stability and gives rise to quantum non-locality.

Based on this geometric architecture, the theory offers mechanistic, unified explanations for numerous foundational physical problems: quantum probability arises from the inability to directly observe the dynamic behavior of particles within the Closed Dimension network; the essence of electron transitions is the energy change caused by an electron entering an adjacent spatial cell; gravity and spacetime curvature are the macroscopic deformation and density gradient of the network induced by the interaction between spatial cells and matter; and the accelerated expansion of the universe is a direct manifestation of the elastic potential energy stored in the overall "compressed state" of the network.

Furthermore, this work achieves a profound integration with string theory, providing string theory with a long-missing, background-independent physical picture—namely, that strings are not merely vibrational modes describing particles and forces, but are themselves the fundamental material constituting spatial cells.
